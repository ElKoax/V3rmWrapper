Will I be adding to this wrapper? 
Yes of course I will, this is just the start. This wrapper is kind of bad atm, but when I get more time I will be re-writing it and even adding a internal IMGUI hook to it. I will also be adding custom functions and fixing the random kicking from the game.

Do I need to credit you if I use this? 
yes you do, just a small "Thanks robomat for the source" or "credits to robomat for the source" would work fine.
Is this skidded? 
No this wrapper is not skidded, I will list all the code I have used from other developers.
Sloppeys Locateint3, but I can easily just use the direct pointer or a AOB.

Retcheck (I use eternal's open source retcheck bypass)

Lua Source (https://lua.org)

ScriptContext Scanner (I can't be asked to write my own, so I used one I found but I could easily write my own)
Is this the source for AtomWrapperX? 
No this isn't AtomWrapperX is far more powerful than this.
Do you scan in your wrapper? 
No I do not, I hook gettop and detour it to my function.

Will you keep this updated? 
If I have time, I will try to update it, but its faily easy to update.
